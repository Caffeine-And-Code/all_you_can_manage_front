# all_you_can_manage_front

to run the project, you need to have installed the <a href="https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install">flutter sdk</a> and the <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio?hl=it">android studio</a> or xcode, depending on the platform you want to run the project (if you just want to test flutter sdk is enough).

After installing the flutter sdk, you can run the project by running the following command in the terminal:

```bash
flutter pub get

flutter run # or just press F5 in the vscode
```
